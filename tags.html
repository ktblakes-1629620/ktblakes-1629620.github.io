	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I grew up in Olympia, Washington, with my parents and two older brothers.  Originally my family is from Orange County, California, so we go back and visit there every summer.  My oldest brother lives in Seattle now, and my other brother lives in New York and performs musical theater.  At UW I am majoring in business and minoring in dance.  I've done ballet for 16 years, as well as other styles of dance like tap and jazz.  I'm still not sure what I want to focus on in business, but hopefully I will be able to figure that out soon!</p>
	<p>In my free time I enjoy going to concerts and music festivals.  For the past two years I've gone to Sasquatch and Bumbershoot with my friends, and it is always a lot of fun.  Some of my favorite concerts I've been to have been Tyler, the Creator and Gucci Mane.  I also watch a lot of TV and movies in my spare time.  One of my favorite shows is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and my favorite movie is probably Talladega Nights.  </p>
